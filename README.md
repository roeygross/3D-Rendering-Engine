# Renderer
In this project, we've conceptualized, designed, and implemented a Java project
that integrated camera capture capabilities into a 3D digital environment using physical models.
The environment is powered by a user-provided database.

The database is located in the BuildRoom test file in the unitests file.
The user can change the data and by that change the camera properties, and the environment properties.

Rendering runtime is reduced with features like multi-threading, and raw AI algorithms for sending rays from the camera to the environment.
